# 🌐 Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)


This project implements i18n and l10n concepts.

## i18n (Internationalization)

The application is designed to support multiple languages without changing application logic.

All UI text is separated using translation dictionaries.

Example:

```python
T["submit"]
T["dashboard"]
T["report"]
```

This allows dynamic language switching.


## l10n (Localization)

The interface is localized into multiple Indian languages.

Supported Languages:

- English 🇬🇧
- Telugu తెలుగు
- Hindi हिन्दी
- Tamil தமிழ்
- Kannada ಕನ್ನಡ
- Malayalam മലയാളം
- Marathi मराठी
- Bengali বাংলা
- Gujarati ગુજરાતી
- Punjabi ਪੰਜਾਬੀ


Users can select their preferred language using the language switch option.
